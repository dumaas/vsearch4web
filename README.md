This webapp is the direct result of my working through the Head First Python book by Paul Barry. Although this book is recommended for those with prior programming knowledge, I went into it completely blind! Building this app has been both deeply challenging and deeply rewarding. Hopefully this repo serves to document my webapp as it progresses from its current half-usable state to a fully-functioning application.
